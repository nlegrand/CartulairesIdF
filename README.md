I'd like to fiddle with medieval latin charters of Île-de-France
edited by the [École nationale des
chartes](http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/cartulaires/). I would love to
try the recent lemmatisation tool for medieval latin developped by
[glossaria.eu](http://www.glossaria.eu/).

ENC licence is a creepy CC by-nc-nd, so the original XML files aren't
for commercial use. Ok, why not. I don't care that much, I'm not into
getting rich with medieval charters, best of luck to the ones who
are. Worse: you can't redistribute those files modified. Ho, I really,
really dislike this one. It means I cannot tweak the file to be
properly loaded in a software (let's say TXM, Philologic, R...)  and
redistribute to a friend or anyone saying "hey check that, it's
awesome". Let's work around this and distribute a software that modify
the sacred ENC TEI files :).
